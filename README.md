# Python-Final-Project
Final Project of Vishnu Ayai

This project was quite interesting for me as I learned a lot and I enjoyed seeing the progress I made with every fix. Suprisingly it was much easier to set up the basic snake game than I thought as there were a lot of references I could use especially from pygames. So setting it up was very easy. However after that it became much more difficult. A lot of my original ideas had to be dropped due to practicality such as some effect ideas for the apples. These ideas included increasing width which caused the game to shut down due to the snake overlapping as well as switching the head and tail due to player difficulty. But there were some fun results because of this such as how I decided to adapt and do more for the aesthetic of the project and focus on the speed aspect. This included the changing color affect which was more tricky then I expected but was very satisfying when completed especially the constantly changing rainbow affect which I discovered by accident. I was also able to learn a lot of jargon through reviewing other python code on pygames which allowed me to better understand the mechanics of the code and appreciate it.
The only major issue I had with the project that did not involve code was recording the video as my laptop would record the code and demo or just not record my voice. To adapt I had to record on my phone which hopefully was enough.
