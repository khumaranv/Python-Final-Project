# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Snakeprise

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Snake game that has more variety when snake eats object

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The game will allow the player to start the game and play the snake as well as retry as much as possible. The game will provide instructions for the player and have a feature that will give the snake a random effect instead of just increasing length. Also be able to keep track of high scores as well as choose between classic or our version. It will be done with pygames. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Snake game is playable, and the snake will have randomized affect when consuming object

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Additional possibilities are ability to have a high score that will be tracked

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Customization options being available for the snake. It will also allow the player to play the classic version or our version.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will have to research the snake games code. Will probably utilize pygames. Will also need to research how to customize the game. To solidify my knowledge I will have to watch past lectures as well.
